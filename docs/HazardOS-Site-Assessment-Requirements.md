# HazardOS: Site Assessment Requirements & Best Practices

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define comprehensive data collection requirements for mobile site assessments

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the information, documentation, and media that must be collected during field site assessments for environmental remediation projects. These requirements are derived from EPA, OSHA, HUD, CDC/NIOSH guidelines and industry best practices for asbestos, mold, and lead paint remediation.

**Key Principle:** The site assessment must capture everything necessary to quote, plan, deploy, conduct, and complete the job without requiring a return visit to the site.

- Clearance testing requirements
- Duration estimate factors

**For Lead Paint:**
- Component quantities by type
- Stabilization vs removal scope
- RRP compliance requirements
- Containment and protection requirements
- Waste handling requirements

---

## Safety Considerations

**PPE for Assessors:**
- Safety glasses (always)
- Gloves (always)
- Respirator (when disturbing materials or heavy dust)

**Site Safety:**
- Never work alone in hazardous conditions
- Identify exits
- Note structural hazards
- Don't disturb suspect materials unnecessarily
- Use flashlight in dark areas (don't rely on phone light)
- Be aware of trip hazards
- Don't enter confined spaces without proper equipment
- Follow client safety protocols
